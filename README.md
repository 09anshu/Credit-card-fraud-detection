# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, which presents a real-world challenge in classification tasks. This project demonstrates how to handle such imbalanced data and build accurate fraud detection models.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Credit card fraud causes huge financial losses each year. Detecting fraud early is critical but difficult due to the rarity of fraud cases. This project applies:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Resampling techniques (SMOTE/undersampling)
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics suited for imbalanced data: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
